# Cat-Vs-Dogs-Classifier
Developed a cat vs. dogs classifier using a pretrained MobileNet model. Leveraging transfer learning, the model was fine-tuned to classify images into two classes: 'cat' and 'dog.' By utilizing the powerful features learned by MobileNet on a large dataset, the classifier achieves high accuracy in distinguishing between cat and dog images.
